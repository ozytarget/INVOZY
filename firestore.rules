/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for InvoiceAI Pro.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model, where users can only
 * access their own data (profiles, estimates, invoices, and clients). Public
 * read access is provided for specific documents via public URLs.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /user_profiles/{userProfileId}: Stores user profiles, with the document ID
 *   matching the Firebase Auth UID.
 * - /users/{userId}/estimates/{estimateId}: Stores estimates created by a
 *   specific user.
 * - /users/{userId}/invoices/{invoiceId}: Stores invoices created by a specific
 *   user.
 * - /users/{userId}/clients/{clientId}: Stores clients created by a specific
 *   user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disabled for the /user_profiles collection.
 * - The 'publicUrl' field in estimates and invoices enables public read access,
 *   but write access remains restricted to authorized users.
 * - Data is segregated by user to enable secure list operations and ensure
 *   users can only list estimates and invoices they own.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The userProfileId is included in both Estimate and Invoice documents to
 *   avoid hierarchical `get()` calls in security rules.
