## Style Guidelines:

- Secondary color: Light gray (#F5F5F5) to provide a clean, neutral backdrop, matching the background color.
- Accent color: Teal (#26A69A) to highlight important actions and information, similar to the 'Issued' and 'Partial' status indicators.
- Headline font: 'Roboto' sans-serif for a modern and readable look, as seen in the invoice titles (e.g., 'August 2025'). Body font: 'Open Sans' sans-serif for general text.
- Use a set of crisp, professional icons to represent various categories, actions, and statuses, enhancing the user interface without clutter.
- Prioritize a clean, fluid layout that adapts seamlessly across devices, with a clear hierarchy of information and interactive elements to ensure usability.
- Incorporate subtle, non-distracting animations for transitions and loading states, creating a smooth, polished user experience.
